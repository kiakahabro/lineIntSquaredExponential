function out = intTwoK(uij, wi, wj, V)
% intTwoK solves the double line integral of the kernel function
%
%                             /1 /1
% K_{ij} = ||w_{i}|| ||w_{j}|||  |  exp((r_{i}(t) - r_{j}(s)).' * V * (r_{i}(t) - r_{j}(s)) ds dt,
%                             /0 /0
%
% where r_{i} = p_{i} + t * w_{i} and r_{j} = p_{j} + s * w_{j}. The
% origins are combined such that u_{ij} = p_{i} - p_{j}.
%
% out = intTwoK(uij, wi, wj, V)
% out is a vector containing 4 elements
% out(1): results
% out(2): absolute error estimated by the gsl integration routine
% out(3): number of function evaluations required by the gsl integration 
%         routine, max = 81, if out(3) == -1, then L1 = L2 = 0, and the 
%         function evaluated a constant.
% out(4): gsl integration routine error code, if code == 0 then no issues. 
%         Otherwise see gsl see referenced paper for description of the inputs
