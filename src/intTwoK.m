% where r_{i}(t) = p_{i} + t * w_{i} and r_{j}(s) = p_{j} + s * w_{j}. The

%
% out = intTwoK(uij, wi, wj, V)
% out is a vector containing 4 elements
% out(1): results
% out(2): absolute error estimated by the gsl integration routine
% out(3): number of function evaluations required by the gsl integration 
%         routine, max = 81, if out(3) == -1, then L1 = L2 = 0, and the 
%         function evaluated a constant.
% out(4): gsl integration routine error code, if code == 0 then no issues. 
%         Otherwise see gsl see referenced paper for description of the inputs
